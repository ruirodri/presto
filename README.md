<b>pRESTo!</b> - <b>REST</b>-based quality orchestration framework

From the point of view of test automation, we live in a prolific time. We have many excellent tools to help us interact with the systems under test; each of these tools has its strengths and weaknesses, some of them more specialized, some of them more generalist.<br />
This is very good. With this variety, our teams can use the tool that makes more sense to its needs and skills.<br />
The downside of this liberty is the complex ecosystem in which most of us live; it is common to have several different tools in use for similar things on the same company, and it makes it challenging to have all the data generated to be correctly fed into the test management tools.<br />
With this point in mind, we started thinking about tools that will help integrate all test automation tools in a unique information flow that goes from the factory floor to the executives. This is pRESTo!.<br />
We designed it as a suite of REST services focused on the testing process to leverage its integration capabilities.<br />
As this is an open project and we intend to become a large community of QA technicians working together to change the level of excellence at which our processes are being treated, we invite you to learn about, use, and contribute to pRESTo!.<br />

The first plugins that we have ready to work on pRESTo! are the following:
<ul>
  <li>A REST endpoint to receive the test results and make them available.</li>
  <li>A REST data source to feed our tests with input data.</li>
  <li>Templates for test scripts using pRESTo!'s services.</li>
  <li>An example Grafana dashboard that generates visualizations on test executions.</li>
  <li>A web application that permits viewing and filtering the test execution results.</li>
</ul>

You are welcome to download the project, contribute to it and use it on your test automation flow.
